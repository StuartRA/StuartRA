Every year I offer two online summer courses through the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH) Department of Mental Health [Summer Institute](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/mental-health/summer-institute). One of these is on propensity scores (more information [here](https://www.jhsph.edu/courses/course/25740/2018/330.626.89/propensity-score-methods-in-non-experimental-resea)), and the other, taught jointly with Trang Nguyen, is on missing data (more information [here](https://www.jhsph.edu/courses/course/25768/2018/330.636.89/methods-for-handling-missing-data-in-psychosocial)).

I also teach a class at JHSPH on causal inference in medicine and public health. It is targeted towards 3rd or 4th year PhD students from across the school who are interested in learning the basic designs for estimating causal effects, with a focus on non-experimental studies. I teach an in-person version of this class during third term and also an online version during fourth term. More information can be found [here](https://www.jhsph.edu/courses/course/26845/2018/140.664.01/causal-inference-in-medicine-and-public-health-i) for the in-person version and [here](https://www.jhsph.edu/courses/course/27297/2018/140.664.81/causal-inference-in-medicine-and-public-health-i) for the online version.
